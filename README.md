# AppDynamics Tibco BW (HAWK) Monitoring Extension


## Use Case

TIBCO BusinessWorksâ„¢ is a family of next-generation, industry-leading enterprise integration products designed to address the new integration challenges faced when transitioning to a digital business.
The Tibco BW Monitoring Extension executes BW methods using BW hawk microagents and presents them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.

**Note : By default, the Machine agent and AppServer agent can only send a fixed number of metrics to the controller. This extension potentially reports thousands of metrics, so to change this limit, please follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO40/Metrics+Limits).**


## Installation

1. Run 'mvn clean install' from tibcohawk-monitoring-extension
2. Copy and unzip TibcoHawkMonitor-\<version\>.zip from 'target' directory into \<machine_agent_dir\>/monitors/
3. Edit config.yaml file in TibcoHawkMonitor/conf and provide the required configuration (see Configuration section)
4. Configure BW hawk methods in metrics.xml file in TibcoHawkMonitor/conf
5. Add the following Tibco jars, console.jar,console_agent_shared.jar,talon.jar,tibrvj.jar,util.jar,jms.jar,security.jar,tibcrypt.jar,tibjms.jar,tibrvjms.jar to lib folder. In BW 5.9 all the jars are available in tibrv folder.
6. Set system variables like RV_HOME, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For more information take a look at https://docs.tibco.com/pub/api-exchange-gateway/2.2.0/doc/html/GUID-86868063-8A1E-4348-8A5A-8B73772036D8.html
7. Restart the Machine Agent.

## Configuration

### config.yaml

**Note: Please avoid using tab (\t) when editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a [yaml validator](http://yamllint.com/).**

| Param | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| displayName | Display name for the hawk domain | "Domin 1" |
| hawkDomain | BW Hawk domain from which we are trying to get the stats from | "testDomain" |
| rvService | RV service to use to connect to hawk | "7474" |
| rvNetwork | RV network to use to connect to hawk | ";" |
| rvDaemon | RV daemon to use to connect to hawk | "tcp:7474" |
| emsURL | EMS URL to use to connect to hawk | "tcp://localhost:7222" |
| emsUserName | EMS user to use to connect to hawk | "admin" |
| emsPassword | EMS userpassword to use to connect to hawk | "admin" |
| bwMicroagentNameMatcher | regex matcher to match and autodetect the BW hawk microagents  | ".\*bwengine.\*" |

### metrics.xml

This file contains the methods to execute using BW hawk micro agents and metrics to collect from the method results.

**Below is an example config for monitoring multiple BW  domains:**

~~~
hawkConnection:
   - displayName: "RV Domain"
     hawkDomain: "testDomain"
     # Supported transport types are tibrv and tibems
     transportType: "tibrv"

     bwMicroagentNameMatcher: [".*bwengine.*testDomain.*"]
     #This pattern is matched with the BW microagent name and the name extracted from specified groups(i.e string matched in the parentheses) is used as the display name. If no group found or invalid group used we will use full microagent name.
     #Example, for "COM.TIBCO.ADAPTER.bwengine.testDomain.TestNew.Process Archive" using the below pattern, display name would be "testDomain-TestNew-Process Archive"

### Support Tickets
If after going through the [Troubleshooting Document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) you have not been able to get your extension working, please file a ticket and add the following information.

Please provide the following in order for us to assist you better.

    1. Stop the running machine agent.
    2. Delete all existing logs under <MachineAgent>/logs.
    3. Please enable debug logging by editing the file <MachineAgent>/conf/logging/log4j.xml. Change the level value of the following <logger> elements to debug.
        <logger name="com.singularity">
        <logger name="com.appdynamics">
    4. Start the machine agent and please let it run for 10 mins. Then zip and upload all the logs in the directory <MachineAgent>/logs/*.
    5. Attach the zipped <MachineAgent>/conf/* directory here.
