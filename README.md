# AppDynamics Tibco BW (HAWK) Monitoring Extension


## Use Case

TIBCO BusinessWorksâ„¢ is a family of next-generation, industry-leading enterprise integration products designed to address the new integration challenges faced when transitioning to a digital business.
The Tibco BW Monitoring Extension executes BW methods using BW hawk microagents and presents them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.

## Prerequisites

Before the extension is installed, the prerequisites mentioned [here](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/Extensions-Prerequisites-Guide/ta-p/35213) need to be met. Please do not proceed with the extension installation if the specified prerequisites are not met.

## Installation

1. Run 'mvn clean install' from tibcohawk-monitoring-extension
2. Copy and unzip TibcoHawkMonitor-\<version\>.zip from 'target' directory into \<machine_agent_dir\>/monitors/
3. Edit config.yml file in TibcoHawkMonitor and provide the required configuration (see Configuration section)
4. Configure BW hawk methods in metrics.xml file in TibcoHawkMonitor
5. Add the following Tibco jars to lib folder. In BW 5.9 all the jars are available in tibrv folder.
```
console.jar,console_agent_shared.jar,talon.jar,tibrvj.jar,util.jar,jms.jar,security.jar,tibcrypt.jar,tibjms.jar,tibrvjms.jar
```
6. Set system variables like RV_HOME, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For more information take a look at https://docs.tibco.com/pub/api-exchange-gateway/2.2.0/doc/html/GUID-86868063-8A1E-4348-8A5A-8B73772036D8.html
7. Restart the Machine Agent.

Please place the extension in the **"monitors"** directory of your **Machine Agent** installation directory. Do not place the extension in the **"extensions"** directory of your **Machine Agent** installation directory.

## Configuration

### config.yml

**Note: Please avoid using tab (\t) when editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a [yaml validator](https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator).**

| Param | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| displayName | Display name for the hawk domain | "Domin 1" |
| hawkDomain | BW Hawk domain from which we are trying to get the stats from | "testDomain" |
| rvService | RV service to use to connect to hawk | "7474" |

### metrics.xml

This file contains the methods to execute using BW hawk micro agents and metrics to collect from the method results.

**Below is an example config for monitoring multiple BW  domains:**

~~~
#Metric prefix used when SIM is enabled for your machine agent
#metricPrefix: "Custom Metrics|Tibco BW|"

#This will publish metrics to specific tier
#Instructions on how to retrieve the Component ID can be found in the Metric Prefix section of https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-do-I-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions/ta-p/28695

## Credentials Encryption
Please visit [this page](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-use-Password-Encryption-with-Extensions/ta-p/29397) to get detailed instructions on password encryption. The steps in this document will guide you through the whole process.

## Extensions Workbench
Workbench is an inbuilt feature provided with each extension in order to assist you to fine tune the extension setup before you actually deploy it on the controller. Please review the following document on [How to use the Extensions WorkBench](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-use-the-Extensions-WorkBench/ta-p/30130)

## Troubleshooting
1. Please follow the steps listed in this [troubleshooting-document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) in order to troubleshoot your issue. These are a set of common issues that customers might have faced during the installation of the extension.
2. Verify Machine Agent Data: Please start the Machine Agent without the extension and make sure that it reports data. Verify that the machine agent status is UP and it is reporting Hardware Metrics.
3. Tibco HAWK BW Microagents: Please verify that BW hawk micro agents are available using hawk display.
4. Check Logs: There could be some obvious errors in the machine agent logs. Please take a look.

**Note**: While extensions are maintained and supported by customers under the open-source licensing model, they interact with agents and Controllers that are subject to [AppDynamicsâ€™ maintenance and support policy](https://docs.appdynamics.com/latest/en/product-and-release-announcements/maintenance-support-for-software-versions). Some extensions have been tested with AppDynamics 4.5.13+ artifacts, but you are strongly recommended against using versions that are no longer supported.
